# Agon — Task Backlog

> Agents: read this at session start. Update as tasks are completed or added. Move completed items to the Completed section. Keep entries concise — this file is injected into every agent context.

## Pending

### Infrastructure

- [ ] **Backend coverage badges** — Extend CI + `update-readme-badges.sh` to collect backend coverage across all backend test projects. Backend test count parsing now supports multi-project output; coverage aggregation is still pending.

### Backend (.NET)

- [ ] **Backend logging** — `ILogger<T>` via DI in Application, Infrastructure, and Api layers. Orchestrator: phase transitions, round progression, convergence scores, patch counts, budget consumption. AgentRunner: dispatch, latency, timeout, token usage. MafCouncilAgent: provider calls, streaming, error/retry. GlobalExceptionMiddleware: unhandled exceptions with correlation IDs. Never log raw user content or agent responses in plaintext.
- [ ] **Orchestrator state machine** — Deterministic phase transitions per `round-policy.instructions.md`. LLM outputs cannot trigger transitions.
- [ ] **`IChatClient` integration** — Provider-agnostic LLM calls via MAF's `IChatClient` (from `Microsoft.Extensions.AI`) + `FakeCouncilAgent` for tests. See `backend-implementation.instructions.md` §1.3.
- [ ] **SignalR event surface expansion** — Extend `/hubs/debate` beyond baseline `RoundProgress` + `TruthMapPatch` to full event set (tokens, convergence, budget warnings, artifacts).
- [ ] **REST API endpoints** — Expand beyond vertical-slice core (`POST /sessions`, `GET /sessions/{id}`, `POST /sessions/{id}/start`, `GET /sessions/{id}/truthmap`) to full surface in `architecture.instructions.md` §6.
- [ ] **PostgreSQL persistence** — Sessions, Truth Map (JSONB + normalised entities), append-only event log.
- [ ] **pgvector semantic memory** — Embedding pipeline + top-K retrieval for agent context.
- [ ] **Redis ephemeral state** — Round state, locks, rate limits.

### Frontend

- [ ] **Connect to real backend** — Replace demo/mock data with REST API + SignalR.
- [ ] **SignalR sequencing** — Keep SignalR for the following branch (or add after REST wiring is stable).
- [ ] **SignalR client integration expansion** — Stream agent tokens, patch deltas, convergence, and budget warnings in real time across thread + Truth Map UI.
- [ ] **Session Timeline Scrubber (Phase 1.5)** — Snapshot access, Pause-and-Replay forks.
- [ ] **Map View (Phase 1.5, desktop)** — Claim graph visualisation.

### Testing

- [ ] **Integration tests** — SignalR event ordering, Truth Map consistency, fork/snapshot immutability.
- [ ] **Snapshot tests** — Artifact Markdown template output.

- [x] Core backend session endpoints — `POST /sessions`, `GET /sessions/{id}`, `POST /sessions/{id}/start`, `GET /sessions/{id}/truthmap`

- [x] CI updated — backend test count captured + combined frontend+backend badge in `update-badges` job
- [x] README badges — xUnit badge added, combined test count (frontend + backend)
